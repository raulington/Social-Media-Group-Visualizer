# Social-Media-Group-Visualizer
In a given social network, who is the most influential person on the network, or the individual in the most friend groups, based on their number of connections? Also, for a random person on the network, how many connections separate this person and the most popular person? 

The team will use the dataset, assign a weight of 1 to each edge, and first use the Betweenness Centrality algorithm to determine the most popular person. Then, we will utilize Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm to find the number of connections that are between a random user of the network and the most influential user.

We used a Facebook Social Circles dataset from the Stanford SNAP group for our project. A link to this dataset can be found [here](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ego-Facebook.html).
