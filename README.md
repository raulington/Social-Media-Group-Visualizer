# Social-Media-Group-Visualizer
How many groups are Facebook composed of? The team will use the data set and run the k-means algorithm on the dataset to determine the number of groups and access to what group a user belongs to through the use of the disjoint set data structure. The team will also visualize the groups through the use of the bread-first search and depth-first search algorithms.
